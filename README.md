# Calculator
A basic calculator capable of doing binary and unary operations utilizing a GUI.

"()" function exactly the same as "{}"
    ex. (1 + 2} == {1 + 2) == 1 + 2
    Brackets and parenthesis are for user clarification only, they both function the EXACT same in this calculator.

Invalid parenthesis balancing will result in "Parenthesis balancing error"
If there is valid parenthesis balancing, and there is still an issue, expressions will result in "NaN" or Not a Number

Multiplication must be specified using "*" operator
    ex. 4(3) != 4 * 3

CE = Clear last entry (not dissimilar to "backspace")
C = Clear screen
